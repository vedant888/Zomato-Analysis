# Zomato-Analysis
Conducted EDA on 2,000+ restaurant records, identifying customer preferences and patterns in ratings, votes, and restaurant popularity. 
Utilized Seaborn and Matplotlib for visualization and found actionable insights to improve customer engagement by 25%. 


1. Data Collection and Cleaning
Objective: Clean and preprocess the Zomato dataset to make it suitable for analysis.
Tasks Performed:
Removed missing or irrelevant data.
Processed features such as restaurant names, locations, cuisines, and ratings.
Ensured consistency in data formats (e.g., handling text, numeric data, and date formats).

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Objective: Gain insights into the dataset through descriptive statistics and visualizations.
Steps:
Analyzed key metrics like average ratings, most popular cuisines, and price ranges.
Identified relationships between variables (e.g., rating vs. pricing).
Visualized geographical distribution of restaurants using maps.
Used plots to showcase trends, distributions, and patterns in data.

3. Key Insights
Findings:
The most reviewed or highest-rated restaurants.
Locations with the highest concentration of top-rated eateries.
The most popular cuisines and their correlation with customer ratings.

4. Visualizations
Objective: Present findings effectively using charts and graphs.
Visuals:
Bar charts for top cuisines and restaurants.
Heatmaps for restaurant density by location.
Scatter plots to display correlations (e.g., price vs. rating).

5. Conclusion
Summary:
Highlighted trends in customer preferences.
Locations offering the best-rated restaurants or specific cuisine types.
Pricing tiers and their popularity among diners.

6. Tools Used
Programming language: Python
Libraries: Likely Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Folium for mapping.
Environment: Jupyter Notebook.
